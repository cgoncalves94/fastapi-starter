# üéì **Software Engineering Features & Principles Applied**

Here are the key software engineering concepts, patterns, and principles implemented in this FastAPI project:

## üèóÔ∏è **Architectural Patterns**

### **1. Vertical (Feature-First) Architecture**
- **Description**: The project is structured around distinct features (`users`, `auth`, `workspaces`), where each feature is a complete vertical slice of the application. This promotes modularity and independent development.
- **Applied Principles**: Domain-Driven Design, Clean Architecture, Bounded Contexts.

### **2. Layered Architecture**
- **Description**: The codebase is organized into distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities, ensuring clear separation of concerns.
- **Layers**:
    - **Router Layer**: Handles HTTP requests, routing, and input validation.
    - **Service Layer**: Contains the core business logic and domain rules.
    - **Repository Layer**: Manages data access and persistence operations.
    - **Database Layer**: The underlying data storage.

### **3. Dependency Injection Pattern**
- **Description**: Dependencies are provided to components rather than being created internally, enhancing testability and flexibility.
- **Applied Concepts**: FastAPI's `Depends()` system (IoC Container), Factory Pattern for creating service and repository instances, and Loose Coupling.

## üîí **Security Patterns**

### **4. Authentication & Authorization Separation**
- **Description**: Authentication (verifying identity) and Authorization (checking permissions) are handled by distinct components, typically in the dependency layer.
- **Applied Concepts**: Dependencies act as "Guards" at the API perimeter, enforcing the Principle of Least Privilege.

### **5. JWT Token-Based Authentication**
- **Description**: JSON Web Tokens are used for secure, stateless authentication.
- **Applied Concepts**: Stateless Authentication, Claims-Based Security (user ID in token payload), and Bearer Token Pattern.

## üéØ **SOLID Principles**

### **6. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- **Description**: Each module, class, or function has one clear, well-defined responsibility.
- **Applied Concepts**: Dedicated service classes (e.g., `UserService` for user logic), repository classes (e.g., `UserRepository` for user data access), and distinct dependencies for authentication and authorization.

### **7. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
- **Description**: High-level modules (like services) depend on abstractions (like repository interfaces), not on low-level details (like concrete database implementations).
- **Applied Concepts**: Services receive repository instances via dependency injection, abstracting direct database interaction.

### **8. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
- **Description**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Applied Concepts**: Pydantic schema inheritance allows extending response models (e.g., `UserResponseComplete`) without altering existing base schemas.

## üìä **Data Access Patterns**

### **9. Repository Pattern**
- **Description**: Provides an abstraction layer between the domain and data mapping layers, allowing data access logic to be centralized and decoupled from business logic.
- **Applied Concepts**: A `BaseRepository(Generic[ModelType])` class provides common CRUD operations through inheritance, while specific repositories (e.g., `UserRepository(BaseRepository[User])`) add domain-specific queries. This decouples services from direct database interaction and enables clean separation between business rules and data persistence.

### **10. SQLModel & Type Safety**
- **Description**: SQLModel is used to define database models, combining the benefits of SQL and Pydantic for type-safe data access and validation.
- **Applied Concepts**: Full type hints from database models to API schemas, and seamless ORM integration.

## üîÑ **Domain Patterns**

### **11. Domain Exception Pattern**
- **Description**: Custom exceptions are defined for specific business errors, which are then translated into appropriate HTTP responses by global handlers.
- **Applied Concepts**: Custom exceptions (`NotFoundError`, `ConflictError`), and global exception handlers for consistent error responses.

## üé® **Design Patterns**

### **12. Factory Pattern**
- **Description**: Used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
- **Applied Concepts**: Dependency injection functions in `dependencies/services.py` act as factories for service and repository instances.

### **13. Adapter Pattern**
- **Description**: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together.
- **Applied Concepts**: Pydantic's `model_validate()` method is used to adapt ORM database models into API response schemas.

## üöÄ **API Design Principles**

### **14. RESTful Design**
- **Description**: Adheres to REST principles for designing web services.
- **Applied Concepts**: Resource-based URLs (e.g., `/users/{id}`), appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE), and meaningful HTTP status codes.

### **15. Consistent Response Patterns**
- **Description**: Ensures uniformity in API responses across different endpoints.
- **Applied Concepts**: Standardized Pydantic schemas for responses, and consistent error response formats via global exception handlers.

### **16. API Versioning**
- **Description**: Manages changes to the API over time without breaking existing client applications.
- **Applied Concepts**: URL versioning using a `/api/v1/` prefix.

## üîß **Code Quality Practices**

### **17. Type Safety**
- **Description**: Extensive use of type hints to catch errors early and improve code readability.
- **Applied Concepts**: Full type hints throughout the codebase, static analysis with MyPy, and runtime validation with Pydantic.

### **18. Modern Python Practices**
- **Description**: Leverages contemporary Python features for efficient and readable code.
- **Applied Concepts**: `async/await` for asynchronous operations, context managers for resource management, and modern type union syntax (`str | None`).

### **19. Configuration Management**
- **Description**: Manages application settings and secrets securely and flexibly.
- **Applied Concepts**: Environment-based configuration using Pydantic Settings, loading from `.env` files, and secure handling of sensitive data.

## üß™ **Development Practices**

### **20. Code Organization**
- **Description**: Logical structuring of the codebase for clarity and maintainability.
- **Applied Concepts**: Domain-based file structure, and clean import management.

### **21. Documentation as Code**
- **Description**: Embedding documentation directly within the codebase.
- **Applied Concepts**: Auto-generated OpenAPI documentation, type hints as self-documentation, and consistent docstring standards.

## üê≥ **Containerization Patterns**

### **22. Docker Containerization**
- **Description**: Application and dependencies are packaged into containers for consistent deployment across environments.
- **Applied Concepts**: Multi-stage Docker builds, dependency isolation, and reproducible environments.

### **23. Service Orchestration**
- **Description**: Multiple services (application + database) are coordinated through container orchestration.
- **Applied Concepts**: Docker Compose service dependencies, health checks, and service networking.

## üóÉÔ∏è **Database Patterns**

### **24. Transaction Management**
- **Description**: Ensures data consistency by treating a sequence of operations as a single, atomic unit.
- **Applied Concepts**: "Unit of Work" pattern (single transaction per request), automatic rollback on exceptions, and atomicity for multi-repository operations.

### **25. Connection Pooling Pattern**
- **Description**: Efficient database connection management through async connection pooling.
- **Applied Concepts**: Async database drivers (asyncpg), connection pool configuration, and resource optimization.

### **26. Database Migration Management**
- **Description**: Version-controlled database schema evolution using Alembic.
- **Applied Concepts**: Forward/backward migrations, schema versioning, and automated migration deployment.
